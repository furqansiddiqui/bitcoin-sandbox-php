# :bulb: Bitcoin lib Sandbox

This is a web app sandbox for my Bitcoin PHP lib (**[furqansiddiqui/bitcoin-php](https://github.com/furqansiddiqui/bitcoin-php)**).  

This sandbox is a collection of tools to evaluate/calculate certain elements of Bitcoin protocol, which are helpful for developers either learning Bitcoin protocol or working with it. For example:

* VarInt encode and decode
* Base58Check encoding and decoding
* WIF encoding and decoding
* etc...
